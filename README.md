This repository contains solutions for the assignment focused on community detection and modularity analysis in network datasets.- Spring, Dr.Rahmani-2023

Assignment Tasks
-------------------------
Collect Three Networks
•  Utilize the three network datasets from previous assignments.

•  Optionally, select other network datasets for additional analysis.

-------------------------

Find Communities in Each Network
•  Apply community detection algorithms to identify communities within each network.

-------------------------
Report Modularity of the Communities
•  Calculate and report the modularity of the detected communities to evaluate the quality of the community structure.
